# EthicsModel

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/N4N71WOHZ3)

A modern, modular PyTorch framework for ethical text analysis, manipulation detection, and narrative understanding. Supports integration with LLM embeddings (e.g., Huggingface Transformers), GraphBrain semantic hypergraphs, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs, e.g., torch-geometric). Features explainability, uncertainty quantification, and advanced graph-based reasoning with comprehensive visualizations using Plotly Express.

## Quick Installation

**1. Sync dependencies (core, training, dev, tests):**
```bash
uv sync --extra full
```

**2. CUDA & bitsandbytes setup:**
- **Linux:**
  ```bash
  bash setup_cuda.sh
  ```
- **Windows (PowerShell):**
  ```powershell
  ./setup_cuda_win.ps1
  ```
  These scripts will:
  - Install the correct CUDA-enabled PyTorch wheel (`torch==2.7.0+cu128`)
  - Install the latest bitsandbytes wheel for your platform
  - Print `Done.` when finished

**3. Install SpaCy language model for GraphBrain:**
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

**4. Test CUDA availability:**
```bash
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__, torch.version.cuda, torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

**5. Run all tests:**
```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Development with Docker (New!)

We've added Docker support to make development easier and more consistent across different environments.

**Using the Development Container with JetBrains IDEs:**

1. **Setup the development container:**
   - **Linux/macOS:**
     ```bash
     chmod +x setup_dev_container.sh
     ./setup_dev_container.sh
     ```
   - **Windows (PowerShell):**
     ```powershell
     .\setup_dev_container.ps1
     ```

2. **Configure JetBrains IDE (PyCharm/IntelliJ) to use the container:**
   - Open the project in your JetBrains IDE
   - Go to File > Settings > Project: ethics-model > Python Interpreter
   - Click on the gear icon and select 'Add'
   - Choose 'Docker Compose' from the left panel
   - Select the docker-compose.yml file in your project
   - Select the 'ethics-model-dev' service
   - Click 'OK' to add the interpreter

3. **Run the project inside the container:**
   - All Python runs, tests, and debugging will now use the containerized environment
   - The container includes all dependencies and proper CUDA setup
   - Code changes are reflected immediately due to volume mounting

**Benefits:**
- Consistent development environment for all contributors
- Proper CUDA and bitsandbytes setup
- All dependencies pre-installed
- Isolated environment without affecting your system Python

## Modular Design

All core model components (custom `nn.Module` classes, layers, blocks, architectures) are organized in the `src/ethics_model/modules/` submodule. The main model is implemented in `src/ethics_model/model.py`.

- **Extendability:** Add your own layers or architectures by creating new files in `modules/` and importing them in your main model.
- **Usage Example:**
  ```python
  from ethics_model.model import EnhancedEthicsModel
  from ethics_model.explainability import EthicsExplainer
  ```

## PyTorch Geometric (GNN) and CUDA

**Note:**
For CUDA support with torch-geometric and its extensions (torch-scatter, torch-sparse, torch-cluster, torch-spline-conv), you must manually install the matching wheels. These are not available on PyPI or the PyTorch index. See the [official PyG installation guide](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/installation.html) for details.
